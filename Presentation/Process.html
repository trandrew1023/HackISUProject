    Challenges we ran into
</h2>
<p>
    75% of our team had never used python before this project, and 100% had never used an Arduino. As this project is heavily based on python programs
    and Arduino hardware, this lead to lots of learning opportunities as we moved through the project. We struggled with some hardware development, primarily
    with voltage spikes causing buttons to falsely trigger events when they hadn't been pushed. Mounting the flash drives to the Pi so that they could be written
    to also caused problems due to unusual issues with Linux processes and permissions. Finally, we had some issues with finding a secure way to implement
    cryptographic functions into our code. However, despite these challenges each taking many hours of collaboration to surmount, we created a feature-complete
    proof-of-concept device.
