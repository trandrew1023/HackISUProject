        <h2>
    Accomplishments that we're proud of
</h2>
    We're primarily proud of creating a working device that accomplishes <br/>
    our primary goal of providing a secure way for journalists to safely <br/>
    and securely smuggle information through physical checkpoints, though <br/>
    we're also proud of how much we all learned in the process of <br/>
    the challenges presented by this project.

    <h2>
        What we learned
    </h2>

    We learned a lot about hardware, python programming, crypto, <br/>
    and debugging hard-to-trace issues that stem from <br/>
    simultaneous hardware and software problems.
    <h2>
        What we learned
    </h2>

    We want to find a way to encrypt and embed larger files, <br/>
    and we're interested in splitting the information across <br/>
    even more devices for heightened operation security <br/>
    and individual plausible deniability.
